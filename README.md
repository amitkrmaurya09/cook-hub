## 🔁 Auth Flow Logic

All authentication logic is centralized:

```
User Action → handleAuthFlow → API → Response → UI Update
```

Example:

* Login success → store token → redirect
* User not found → switch to Register
* Register → OTP screen
* Forgot → Reset password

👉 Managed inside:

## 🔐 Token Handling

```js
localStorage.setItem("token", res.token);
```

* Used to detect login state
* Controls protected actions (like Create recipe)
